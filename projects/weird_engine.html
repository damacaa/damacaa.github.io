            <p>As we all know, it's hard to find time to work on personal projects after work. That's probably why this
                project is still so poorly documented.<br></p>

            <p>This project started as a 3D game engine that seamlessly combined traditional triangle rasterization with
                a more unique approach SDF Ray Marching. This was quite a challenge, but eventually I got it working as
                intended.</p>

            <img src="../img/projects/weird-engine/3d.png">

            <p>I quickly realized the scale of what I was trying to do, and the implications of trying to get an
                acceptable performance using such an expensive rendering technique. The retro aesthetics were not a
                design choice, but rather a technical limitation. The rendering algorithm's complexity grew exponentialy
                with the amout of objects, so it required implemented complex acceleration structures, similar to the
                ones used for ray tracing. Baking static SDFs to meshes was also an option, but it would loose most of
                its charm.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>Then came the idea of moving to 2D. Scaling down meant the project would be in a more realistic scope. In
                2D, I could easily adapt the rendering method to grow linearly.
                <br>
            </p>

            <p>As a side bonus, 2D physics are way less complex, and this allowed my little physics engine to run
                thousands of objects easily.
