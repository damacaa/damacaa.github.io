            <p>Pond Platoon was developed for a university degree subject. The team
                consisted of 6 people: an artist, two game designers, two game programmers,
                and a project manager. We had four months to build a casual browser game,
                although we still had other classes, so we couldn't spend 100% of our time
                working on this.<br>

            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>I implemented the main mechanics of the game.</li>
                <li>I created a system to generate procedural worlds and implemented a
                    path-finding
                    algorithm for the enemies.</li>
                <li>I learnt a lot about teamwork
                    and collaborating with a multidisciplinary team.</li>
                <li>I assisted the art team in creating visually appealing visual effects
                    like particles or animations and the overall look and feel of the game.
                </li>
            </ul>

            We decided we wanted to make a tower-defense game, and we thought that
            making it in 3D and having the player rotate the world to continuously check
            on the enemies would be a nice twist. I was tasked with building the worlds,
            as well as the main gameplay mechanics.<br>

            <div style="display: flex; flex-flow: wrap; width: 100%; padding: 2em 0; margin: auto;">
                <img src="../img/projects/PondPlatoon/gameplay_1.gif" style="width: 33.33%;  margin: 0;">
                <img src="../img/projects/PondPlatoon/gameplay_2.gif" style="width: 33.33%; margin: 0;">
                <img src="../img/projects/PondPlatoon/gameplay_3.gif" style="width: 33.33%; margin: 0;">
            </div>

            Building the procedurally generated worlds meant having to learn about 3D
            Perlin noise and generating voxel meshes. Also, having infinite worlds
            required building an enemy AI capable of traveling through them. The default
            pathfinding in Unity didn't quite work for this application, so I built a
            path-finding system from scratch, using the A* algorithm.<br>
