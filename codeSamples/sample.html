// This code was used in <a href="https://damaca.itch.io/same-boat" target="_blank">We're in the Same Boat</a>.
// It is a C# class that implements the A* algorithmon a puzzle game that's built around the command pattern.
// It can find the optimal set of movements to solve a river crossing puzzle. The logic of the game is completely
// decoupled from the solver, making it much easier to maintain.
