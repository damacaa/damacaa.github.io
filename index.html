                    I have been fascinated by the process of creating video games since I was a kid, playing Pokemon
                    Fire Red and wondering how they fit all those creatures inside of a GameBoy. When I found out years
                    later that I could make a living doing this, it was clear that this was what I wanted to do.
                    <br><br>
                    As I learned more about game development, I started hacking and tinkering with mods for some of my
                    favorite games, such as Minecraft, Skyrim, or Garry's Mod. Even when I didn't know how to code, I
                    spent a lot of time making Minecraft texture packs and Redstone contraptions.
                    <br><br>
                    Now, I'm a recent graduate in video game development. Making games has become my passion. I love
                    solving hard problems and building clean and maintainable code. I continuously spend my time
                    learning about new design patterns, algorithms, or new technologies that help me build better games.

                                <h3>Pond Platoon</h3>
                                <p>Pond Platoon was developed for a university degree subject. The team consisted of 6
                                    people: an artist, two game designers, two game programmers, and a project manager.
                                    We had four months to build a casual browser game, although we still had other
                                    classes, so we couldn't spend 100% of our time working on this.
                                    <br><br>
                                    We decided we wanted to make a tower-defense game, and we thought that making it in
                                    3D and having the player rotate the world to continuously check on the enemies would
                                    be a nice twist. I was tasked with building the worlds, as well as the main gameplay
                                    mechanics.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Building the procedurally generated worlds meant having to learn about 3D Perlin
                                    noise and generating voxel meshes. Also, having infinite worlds required building an
                                    enemy AI capable of traveling through them. The default pathfinding in Unity didn't
                                    quite work for this application, so I built a path-finding system from scratch,
                                    using the A* algorithm.
                                    <br><br>

                                <p>We were once asked to design a character, build its background, and make the required
                                    concept art for it. After that, we would model and animate it, bring it to life in
                                    Unity, and build a cloth simulation to make it more interesting.

                                    Completing a project like this is a complex process that requires a variety of
                                    skills, and one of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of the process for me
                                    was designing and developing the main character of this game. This involved not only
                                    drawing and sketching the character, but also modeling it in 3D, texturing it to
                                    give it the desired appearance, and programming its movement and interactions with
                                    the game world.
                                    <br><br>
                                    One of the most challenging parts of the process was creating a realistic cloth
                                    simulation for the character's cape. It required me to have a deep understanding of
                                    physics and how cloth behaves to create a believable and visually impressive effect.
                                    It was a lot of trial and error to get the right balance between realism and
                                    performance, but in the end, it was worth it.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Overall, the process of designing and developing the main character was a
                                    challenging but incredibly rewarding experience. It allowed me to combine my
                                    artistic skills with my programming knowledge to create a truly immersive and
                                    believable character that players could connect with and care about. It was a great
                                    learning experience.

                                <p>Back when I was 17, I made this game with zero knowledge of game development. I
                                    had just
                                    played Machinarium, and I was in love with its aesthetics, so I tried to emulate
                                    it. I
                                    made the sprites with water colors, animated them with After Effects and pasted
                                    them
                                    into a pre-made Unity project.</p>
