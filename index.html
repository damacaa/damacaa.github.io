                            <p>Puzzle game made in Unity based on a classic riddle. Planning to release it for mobile
                                platforms soon. <br>
                                I implemented all of the game mechanics and logic of the game, I made a
                                system to easily create puzzles with a set of actor and rules, and I implemented a
                                solver to automatically ensure that every level can be solved and get the optimal set of
                                moves to complete it.

                                I implemented the main mechanics as well as the
                                procedural world generation and enemy AI and path-finding. I learnt a lot about teamwork
                                and collaborating with a multidisciplinary team.</p>

                            <p>In my third year of university, I attended a subject about 3D animation. We learnt the
                                basics, modelled a character and a small stage and implemented some basic mechanics in
                                Unity. Finally, we learned about procedural animation with physics and implemented our
                                own soft-body physics simulations in Unity.</p>

                            <p>A multiplayer web game I made a few years ago with Phaser3.<br>
                                It was my first game as a
                                game programmer, and it's a mess. But I learnt a lot from it, since I built both the
                                client in JavaScript and the server with Java.</p>

                        <h3>My first game ever</h3>
                        <p>Back when I was 17, I made this game with zero knowledge of game development. I had just
                            played Machinarium, and I was in love with its aesthetics, so I tried to emulate it. I
                            made the sprites with water colors, animated them with After Effects and pasted them
                            into a pre-made Unity project.</p>
